  <h1 class="title">Task 3</h1> 
  
    <p class="caption">It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high 
        time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut 
        them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the 
        second one â€” into b pieces. </br>

        Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration 
        (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. 
        Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between 
        the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following 
        conditions are met:</br>

    </p>
        <div class="caption__ol">
            <ol>
                <li>Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;</li>
                <li>Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;</li>
                <li>No plate contains pieces of both cakes.</li>
            </ol></br>
        </div>
    <p class="caption">
        To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in 
        such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is 
        maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible 
        number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the 
        aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x 
        pieces of cake.</br>
        
        Help Ivan to calculate this number x!
